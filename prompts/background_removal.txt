Professional product photography background removal task:

1. IDENTIFY the main product/object in the center of the image
2. REMOVE all background elements completely, creating perfect transparency
3. PRESERVE these critical details:
   - All product edges with pixel-perfect precision
   - Original shadows and reflections that are part of the product itself
   - Product textures, labels, and branding exactly as shown
   - Original color accuracy and saturation
   - Any transparent or semi-transparent parts of the product (like glass)

4. ENSURE clean extraction:
   - No background remnants or halos around edges
   - Smooth, anti-aliased edges without jaggedness
   - Maintain fine details like hair, fabric threads, or text
   - Keep the product's natural drop shadow if it enhances realism

5. OUTPUT requirements:
   - PNG format with full alpha channel transparency
   - Same resolution as input image
   - Product centered in frame with original proportions

Focus on e-commerce quality standards for professional product photography.
